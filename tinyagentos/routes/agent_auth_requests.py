"""Routes for the external-agent consent loop (Phase 1).

POST   /api/agents/auth-requests                       — submit an access request (EXEMPT, no auth)
GET    /api/agents/auth-requests/{request_id}          — poll request status (EXEMPT, opaque-id cap)
POST   /api/agents/auth-requests/{request_id}/approve  — approve + mint identity (admin only)
POST   /api/agents/auth-requests/{request_id}/deny     — deny the request (admin only)
GET    /api/agents/auth-requests                       — list pending requests (admin only)

The two public endpoints (create + status poll) are added to auth_middleware.EXEMPT_PATHS
so unauthenticated external agents can reach them.  The opaque UUID request_id acts as a
capability token for the poll endpoint — only the caller who received the id can poll it.

Security notes
--------------
* The token field is returned ONLY on status == 'accepted'.
* Admin gate on approve / deny / list — checked via current_user + is_admin flag.
* Abuse cap: at most _PENDING_CAP pending requests per (identity_claim, framework) pair;
  further submissions receive 429.
