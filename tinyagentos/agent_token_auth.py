"""Shared registry-JWT scope check for agent-authenticated routes.

A registered agent authenticates to taOS with its OWN Ed25519 registry JWT
(minted by ``mint_registry_token`` / verified by ``verify_registry_token``),
never the owner password.  ``check_agent_scope`` is the single verify path used
by every route that accepts an agent token:

  - routes/agent_registry.py  -> required_scope "registry_feeds_read"
  - routes/a2a_bus.py         -> required_scope "a2a_receive"

Semantics (fail closed):
  - No Authorization Bearer header -> return None (the caller decides what to do,
    typically reject; the admin session/local-token path is handled before this).
  - Bearer present but malformed / bad signature / missing sub -> 401.
  - Valid signature but the agent is not active in the registry, the sub is
    unknown, or the required scope grant is missing/expired -> 403.

The registry JWT itself carries no exp claim; revocation is achieved by
suspending the agent (status != 'active') or by setting expires_at on the grant.
